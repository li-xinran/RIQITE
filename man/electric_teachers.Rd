\title{Teachers of Electric Circuits Professional Development}
\format{
A data frame with 233 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{Site}}{character - Site ID (city where teachers were
recruited).  Randomization occured within site.}
\item{\code{T.ID}}{double - Teacher ID}
\item{\code{Tx}}{character -
Treatment group.  "D" is control.}
\item{\code{TxAny}}{double - Flag
for any treatment (main analysis did not find major differences of
PD approach.)}
\item{\code{Per.1}}{double - Baseline knowledge
(percent correct)}
\item{\code{Per.2}}{double - Endline knowledge
(percent correct)}
\item{\code{gain}}{double - Total gain from pre
to post.} }

\description{
This dataset describes the baseline and final test
scores on a test measuring the knowledge of electric circuits
given to teachers who were part of a randomized controlled trial
of a professional development program.

The trial had three treatment arms (different approaches to the
professional development) and a control arm.

The gain (post score - pre score) for all teachers is the change in the percentage point correct
on the test of electric circuit knowledge (we call this "content knowledge").

\details{
Not all treatments were given in a site; PD program was
delivered to classes of teachers.  Teachers individually
randomized to class, but there could be class (or PD teacher)
effects.
