#'@title Teachers of Electric Circuits Professional Development
#'
#'@description This dataset describes the baseline and final test
#'  scores on a test measuring the knowledge of electric circuits
#'  given to teachers who were part of a randomized controlled trial
#'  of a professional development program.
#'
#'  The trial had three treatment arms (different approaches to the
#'  professional development) and a control arm.
#'
#'  The gain (post score - pre score) for all teachers is the change
#'  in the percentage point correct on the test of electric circuit
#'  knowledge (we call this "content knowledge").
